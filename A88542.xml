            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THat about a fortnight before the conclusion of the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her two daughters came to <hi>Breda</hi> to the <hi>Scots</hi> King <hi>Charls,</hi> and went not thence till the King went to <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleidike,</hi> a House of the Prince of <hi>Oranges.</hi> That during that time this Informant saw the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> divers times in presence with the said King, and every day with the said King at the Court there, he being there with the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her two daughters, to take <hi>their leave</hi> (as they said) of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> before he went to <hi>Scotland.</hi> That severall Officers, about <hi>thirty</hi> in number, made a Petition to the said King, to entertain them to fight for him against the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> by the name of <hi>Barbarous and Inhumane Rebels,</hi> either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the recovering of his just Rights, and re-instating him in his Throne, and deputed this Informant and Colonell <hi>Drury</hi> to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125194:3"/>present the said Petition, who <hi>indeed drew</hi> the same. That when the Informant &amp; some other Officers came to the Court at <hi>Breda,</hi> intending to present the said Petition immediately to the Kings hand, but finding the L. <hi>Craven</hi> very near to him, likewise the Marquess of <hi>Mewcastle,</hi> who presented his brother Sir <hi>Charls Cavendish</hi> to kiss the said Kings hand the evening before the said Kings departure, who this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant saw kiss the Kings hand accordingly: the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gerrard, &amp;c.</hi> and a great bustle of business; This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, with Colonell <hi>Drury,</hi> applied themselves to the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> intreating him to present the Petition to the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to present it to the K. of <hi>Scots:</hi> the said Lord <hi>Craven</hi> taking the petition, and reading the same cheerfully, said to Colonell <hi>Drury</hi> and this Informant, <hi>There is the Queen of Bohemia, deliver it to her, and I will speak for you.</hi> Upon which they applied themselves to the said Queen, and she presented the Petition. After which the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>New castle,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with some other Lords, went into a withdrawing room, where this Informant and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could not enter: But the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> came forth of the withdrawing chamber, and told this informant and company, <hi>That they should receive an answer from the Queen of Bohemia to their petition, and that he had spoken to the Queen of Bohemia in their behalf,</hi> who afterward came and told this Informant and company, that she had delivered their Petition, and that the King had taken order for it. The <hi>next morning</hi> at three of the clock the <hi>King departed;</hi> but this Informant and company had their quarters satisfied by the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> according to the said Kings order upon their Petition, and thereby to inable them to follow the said King in the prosecution of these wars against the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> which was the effect of their aforesaid petition.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125194:3"/>That this Informans saw the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> very often and familiar with the said King, and enter with the said King into the withdrawing chamber, and staid there the last night the said King was at <hi>Breda,</hi> very late.</p>

These particulars following are offered for further satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Colonel <hi>Drury,</hi> who (as the said <hi>Falconer</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Information, was deputed with him to deliver the Petition at <hi>Breda</hi>) testified upon his oath in Court, that there was no such Petition drawn or presented by him and <hi>Falconer,</hi> as is mentioned in <hi>Falconers</hi> Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125194:5"/>to be subscribed by about 30 Officers, and which was delivered by them to the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> wherein the Parlament of England was called by the name of <hi>Barbarous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Rebels,</hi> or wherein there was the least mention made of the Parlament. And for a confirmation of the truth of his testimony he produced in Court the very Original petition of <hi>Falconers</hi> own hand-writing: which being then read in Court in the presence of <hi>Falconer,</hi> he offered not in the least manner to except against it, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could he, when <hi>Falconer</hi> was produced against <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner.</hi> The Petition was in these words following,</p>

            <p>There were three other Witnesses produced, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise subscribed the Petition at <hi>Breda,</hi> all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Testimony of <hi>Drury;</hi> and withall informing the Court that they were then in a starving condition, and that which they petitioned for was meerly to discharge

            <p>As to the infamy of the said <hi>Falconer,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It was proved at the Trial by testimony of good credit, that the said <hi>Falconer</hi> said, I have spent my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers estate and my own, I will never want mony, for whilst there is any in the Nation I will get it one way or other, and I will do something of <hi>Infamy</hi> to be talked of, that the name of <hi>Falconer</hi> shall never dye.</item>
                  <item>2. It was proved in Court by testimony of some of the Inhabitants of <hi>Petersfield,</hi> That he drank a health to the <hi>Devil upon his knees,</hi> in the market-place there.</item>
                  <item>3. It was proved likewise in Court, that he frequently said, our Saviour Christ was a bastard, and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> a whore.</item>
                  <item>4. Proved also that he gave a man 20 <hi>s.</hi> in gold, and would have had him to consent to permit him to Bugger him, saying, <hi>Dam him, sink him, He would Bugger his soul to hell.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. That he was in <hi>Alisbury</hi>-Jaile for suspition of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, before he was imployed as a Spy into <hi>Holland,</hi> and his partner committed there with him was hanged, proved in Court by the Jailor of <hi>Alisbury;</hi> And after he came over, he was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> likewise for suspition of Felonny, and divers Charges against him proved in Court by Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> one of the Iustices of peace, who took his Examination upon his Commitment.</item>
                  <item>6. It was likewise proved in Court, his personating of other men, and his counterfeiting of hands to get mony.</item>
                  <item>7. It was confessed by his own Witnesses at the said Trial, that <hi>Falconer</hi> was purposely imployed into <hi>Holland</hi> as a Spy, and proved by other witnesses that he had a reward; and proved also by Mr. <hi>Woolridge</hi> of <hi>Clements-Inne,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:125194:6"/>what he said to him of the great reward he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for his information against the Lord <hi>Craven.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other two witnesses, <hi>Kitchingman</hi> and <hi>Riley,</hi> they depose nothing as to the said Petition pretended to be delivered at <hi>Breda:</hi> They only informing that the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> was at <hi>Breda,</hi> and frequently in the presence of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> there, which certainly can be no crime to confiscate any mans estate; The King of <hi>Scots</hi> coming out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> was by command of his Generals under whom he had a Charge, and where also he had resided by leave from the Parlament ever since the beginning of the war in <hi>England.</hi> Besides, there is not the least proof by these witnesses, that the Lord <hi>Craven said one word,</hi> or <hi>did one deed</hi> against the Parlament of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas in the Votes of Confiscation it is exprest, That the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> is voted an offend or within the Declaration of the 24. of <hi>August</hi> 1649. whereupon his estate was confiscated,</p>
            <p>First, it is to be observed, that there was no Act nor Ordinance which (as the case stood with the Lord <hi>Craven</hi>) could bring him within the reach of Confiscation, and thereupon resort was had to the said declaratory Vote.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this Declaration was made meerly in reference to <hi>Ireland,</hi> appears by the Letters dated the 15. of <hi>August</hi> 1649. read that day in the House from Sir <hi>Charls Coot,</hi> when that declaratory Vote and several other Votes in reference to <hi>Ireland</hi> passed: In one of whose Letters then read in Parlament, Sir <hi>Charls Coot</hi> had this passage, <hi>That the Parlaments interest in those parts was in danger to be wholly lost, and the Forces under his command likely to be ruined and destroyed by a numerous party of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>and</hi> Scots <hi>under the conduct of the Lord os</hi> Ards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:125194:6"/>
            <p> Upon the reading of which Letters the said Vote did pass, which in this Case is made use of as a Declaratory Law to confiscate the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> Estate, but is only entred in the Journal of Parlament as a <hi>Resolve upon the question,</hi> without ever being reduced into a Law, or publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made thereof, to the end all the subjects of this State might take notice of their concernment therein, as a Law whereupon depended the forfeiture of life and estate. The Vote, as entred in the Journal, follows.</p>
